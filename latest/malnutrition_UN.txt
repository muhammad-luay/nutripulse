Key findings of the 2025 edition
2 UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Group – Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates 2025 edition
Malnutrition is a violation of children’s
rights, while good nutrition sets children on
the path to grow, develop, learn and reach
their full potential. Despite significant
progress over the past two decades, the
UNICEF, WHO, World Bank global and
regional child malnutrition estimates
reveal that we are still far from a world
without malnutrition.
The joint estimates, published in 2025,
cover indicators of stunting, wasting,
severe wasting and overweight among
children under 5. Globally, there are
150.2 million children under 5 affected
by stunting. These children begin their
lives at a marked disadvantage: they may
never attain their full possible height and
their brains may never develop to their full
cognitive potential.
There are also 42.8 million children under
5 suffering from wasting, of which 12.2
million have severe wasting. Children with
wasting have weakened immunity, are
susceptible to long term developmental
delays, and face an increased risk of
death, particularly when wasting is
severe. The number of children affected
by wasting and severe wasting reported
by the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates
(JME) are prevalence-based estimates
predominantly based on survey data.
These estimates should be considered
an underestimate of the annual burden
as they do not account for the cumulative
number of cases that occur throughout
the year.
Across the globe, childhood overweight
and obesity are rising threats to children’s
nutrition. There are now 35.5 million
children living with overweight globally,
an increase of 2.4 million since 2000.
The emergence of overweight and
obesity has been shaped by harmful food
environments, including industry marketing
and greater access to processed foods
along with lower levels of physical activity.
The Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) set ambitious targets for
eliminating child malnutrition in all its
forms. The world has made important
progress towards these targets, including
declines in child stunting that have
continued for more than two decades.
However, the JME reveals that this
progress is insufficient to achieve the
SDG targets by 2030.
Recent trends indicate a potential rise in
stunting that puts the last two decades of
progress at risk. While stunting trends are
concerning, a trend towards declining child
wasting signals progress in addressing
the immediate causes of malnutrition.
Rates of child overweight have remained
unchanged over time, highlighting the need
for more effective strategies to improve
children’s food environments.
In some regions, demographic shifts are
contributing to a decline in the overall
number of malnourished children, while
other regions are not benefiting from
demographic change. This uneven
progress underscores the complexity of
addressing child malnutrition globally and
the importance of country-led efforts to
give every child access to the nutritious
diets, essential services and positive care
practices they need to survive and thrive.
Improving children’s nutrition requires
effective and sustained multisystems
efforts – driven by robust data on the
nutrition situation – to prevent malnutrition
before it starts and ensure early detection
and treatment when prevention falls short.
However, prior to the reduction of financial
resources in development aid in 2025, a
decrease in the availability of monitoring
data for child malnutrition was noted
corresponding with the period of COVID-19
pandemic, economic crises and the
conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.
An absence of data undermines informed
analysis and increases uncertainty about
national progress towards reducing child
malnutrition. Regular data collection
is critical to monitor and analyse
country, regional and global progress
going forward.
Defining the forms of malnutrition* highlighted in this key findings report
Stunting
and
wasting
Stunting
and
overweight
Stunting refers to a child who is too short for
his or her age. Children affected by stunting
can suffer severe irreversible physical and
cognitive damage that accompanies stunted
growth. The devastating consequences of
stunting can last a lifetime and even affect
the next generation.
* Some children suffer from more than one form of malnutrition – such as stunting
and overweight or stunting and wasting. There are currently no joint global or
regional estimates for these combined conditions.
INTRODUCTION
SLIPPING PROGRESS ON STUNTING THREATENS GLOBAL
GAINS IN REDUCING CHILD MALNUTRITION
Wasting refers to a child who is too
thin for his or her height. Wasting is the
result of recent rapid weight loss or the
failure to gain weight. A child who is
moderately or severely wasted has an
increased risk of death, but treatment
is possible.
Overweight refers to a child who is too heavy
for his or her height. This form of malnutrition
results when energy intakes from food
and beverages exceed children’s energy
requirements. Overweight increases the risk
of diet-related noncommunicable diseases
later in life.
The new Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates of 2025 supersede former analyses and results
published by UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank Group

Number (millions) of children under 5 affected by
stunting, wasting and overweight, global, 2000–2024
Percentage of children under 5 affected by stunting,
wasting and overweight, global, 2000–2024
Most children with malnutrition live in Africa and Asia
In 2024, more than half of all
children under 5 affected by
stunting lived in Asia and two out of
five lived in Africa
Asia 51% Africa 43%
In 2024, almost half of all children
under 5 affected by overweight lived in
Asia and more than one quarter lived
in Africa
Asia 46% Africa 27%
In 2024, 70 per cent of all children
under 5 affected by wasting lived in
Asia and more than one quarter lived
in Africa
Asia 70% Africa 27%
After a decade of declines in stunting, new data show a worrying halt to progress.
While overweight has remained unchanged, 8 million fewer children are suffering
from wasting today than in 2012.

PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SDGs
Nearly 80 per cent of children under 5 live in countries that are on track or show
some progress in stunting
Source: UNICEF, WHO, World Bank Group Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates, 2025 edition. Note: *Percentages may not add up to 100 per cent due to rounding. **See notes on progress assessment categories on page 20.
The graphics above show progress towards
the SDG 2.2 targets on stunting, wasting and
overweight. The graphics in the left-hand
column show progress by percentage of the
global under-five population and the graphics
in the two right-hand columns show progress
by percentage of countries (globally and
regionally).
For the graphics by percentage of the underfive population (left column), each country was
weighted by the under-five population. For the
graphs of the percentage of countries – global
and regional, each country contributes equally
towards the percentages, regardless of its
population size.
Almost all children live in countries where
progress assessment is available for all
three indicators. Meanwhile, progress by
country can only be assessed for 80 percent
of countries for the stunting and overweight
targets and for about 66 percent of countries
for the wasting target.
When considering progress by under-five
population, 78 per cent of children live in
countries showing at least some progress
towards the stunting reduction target, with
19 per cent living in countries that show
no progress or a worsening situation. For
overweight: 58 percent of children live in
countries with no progress or a worsening
situation. For wasting, 40 per cent of children
live in countries with no progress or a
worsening situation.
At the regional level, Northern America,
Europe and Australia and Oceania have the
highest proportion of countries for which
progress cannot be assessed across the
three indicators. Conversely, Africa has the
highest proportion of countries for which
progress can be assessed for all three
indicators. Asia is contributing most to the
global percentage of countries that are
‘on track’ to meet the stunting target, with
21 out of 48 countries (or 44 per cent) on
track; followed by Europe with 17 out of 42
countries on track. In Africa and Asia, nearly
30% or more of countries are either seeing
no progress or have worsening trends in child
wasting. In Europe, Latin America and the
Caribbean, Oceania and Northern America,
only one country or less per region is found to
be on track for overweight.
Gaps in data in some regions make
challenging to accurately assess progress
towards global targets. Regular data collection
(every three to five years) is therefore critical
to monitor and analyse country, regional
and global progress on child malnutrition
going forward.

The Joint Child
Malnutrition
Estimates (JME)
do not adjust for
the cumulative
annual incidence of
child wasting when
calculating numbers
affected.
The JME global and regional
estimates on wasting and
severe wasting are aligned
with the SDG indicator
definition and are based on
national-level prevalence
data which capture the cases
of wasting at a given moment
in time. As such, they do
not reflect the cumulative
number of cases of wasting
that occur over the course of
a year (Isanaka et al, 2021).
The JME global estimates
of 42.8 million children
under 5 affected by wasting
and 12.2 million affected
by severe wasting in 2024
should be considered as an
underestimate of the total
number of children affected
over the course of the year.
Wasting is a form of acute
malnutrition that can
fluctuate due to seasonal
patterns, environmental
shocks and conflict, all
of which can disrupt food
security and access to clean
water and healthcare. The
JME does not adjust for
seasonal factors that may
affect wasting prevalence
estimates.

While only about half of all children under 5 live in lower-middle income countries,
these countries are home to almost two-thirds of children with stunting and
three-quarters of children with wasting
Source: UNICEF, WHO, World Bank Group Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates, 2025 edition. Note: 1. Share is relative to the total number affected across the four country-income groups; this varies from the global totals reported elsewhere in this
brochure because the official JME global total is based on a model of United Nations regions. The differences are as follows: Stunting official global estimate 150.2 million; sum of four country-income groups = 149.8 million. Wasting official global
estimate 42.8 million; sum of country-income groups = 40.1 million. Overweight official global estimate 35.5 million; sum of 4 country-income groups = 35.3 million. The percentages for distribution of wasting and overweight do not add up to 100
per cent due to rounding.
While only about half of all children under 5 live in lower-middle-income countries, two thirds of all
children affected by stunting and three quarters of all children with wasting live there

Notes: 1. Excluding the Russian Federation; 2. For wasting and severe wasting, the estimates were derived applying mixed-effect models with sub-regions as fixed effects (de Onis et al. 2004). Data were available only for Australia, preventing the estimation of confidence
intervals. Model selection is based on best fit.

Notes: 1. Excluding the Russian Federation; 2. For wasting and severe wasting, the estimates were derived applying mixed-effect models with sub-regions as fixed effects (de Onis et al. 2004). Data were available only for Australia, preventing the estimation of confidence
intervals. Model selection is based on best fit. The numbers affected do not always sum to the reported total due to rounding. *Complete data series for stunting, wasting, severe wasting and overweight (2000 to 2024) of prevalence and numbers affected can be found
at the websites listed on page 22 for global as well as for the following groupings: (i) United Nations regions and sub-regions; (ii) UNICEF regions; (iii) WHO regions; (iv) World Bank country income classifications; (v) World Bank regions; (vi) SDG regions; and (vii) the Food

RECENTNESS OF DATA SOURCES
Two-thirds of the global child population live in countries with data collected
on stunting, wasting and overweight within the past five years
The graphics on the following page show the
recentness of the latest available country
data points on malnutrition (e.g., from a
household survey) among children under 5
years in the JME. The graphics in the left-hand
column are by percentage of the under-five
population and the graphics in the right-hand
column are by the percentage of countries.
For the graphics by percentage of the
under-five population, the availability of
data for each country was weighted by the
under-five population, meaning that more
populous countries contributed more to
the percentages in each category than less
populous ones.
Globally, about two-thirds of children live in
countries where data on malnutrition are
available in the last five years. Less than
5 per cent of children live in countries with
no data at all. This suggests that the modelled
regional and global estimates are highly
representative of the situation of the majority
of children across the globe for the most
recent period.
The situation by percentage of countries
(right-hand column) looks vastly different, with
less than half of all countries having at least
one data point in the last five years and nearly
one quarter of countries with no data at all.
This indicates that the governments of many
countries are not able to adequately assess
and plan programmes to identify, prevent and
treat malnutrition.
Gaps in the data make it challenging to
accurately estimate the prevalence of
malnutrition. Regular data collection (every
three to five years) is critical to properly plan
and monitor programmes to combat child
malnutrition at country, regional and global
levels going forward.
The thresholds presented in
Table 1 were established through
the WHO-UNICEF Technical
Advisory Group on Nutrition
Monitoring (TEAM) (de Onis
et al. 2018) and released in
2018. These thresholds have
been used for development of
prevalence-based assessments
in maps and tables in this
brochure. The thresholds were
developed in relation to standard
deviations (SD) of the normative
WHO Child Growth Standards.
The international definition of
‘normal’ (two SD from the WHO
standards median) defines the
first threshold, which includes
2.3 per cent of the area under
the normalized distribution.
Multipliers of this ‘very low’ level
(rounded to 2.5 per cent) set the
basis for establishing subsequent
thresholds.
